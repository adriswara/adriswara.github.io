            Nürburgring is a 150,000-capacity motorsports complex located in the town of Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It features
            a Grand Prix race track built in 1984, and a much longer old "North loop" track which was built in the 1920s
            around the village and medieval castle of Nürburg in the Eifel mountains. The north loop is 20.8 km (12.9 mi)
            long and has more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) of elevation change from its lowest to highest points. Jackie
            Stewart nicknamed the old track "The Green Hell".[1]
